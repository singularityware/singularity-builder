# Singularity Builder
This is a [packer](https://www.packer.io/docs/command-line/build.html) configuration to generate build instances (images) on different cloud platforms. I am just in the process of testing!


	packer build builder.json 
	googlecompute output will be in this color.

	==> googlecompute: Creating temporary SSH key for instance...
